Japanese files, books and more

You will find different kind of resources for learning japanese, mostly for beginners but I'll add more advanced stuff later on.

Enjoy!
<hr/>

### Genki Folder has 4 PDF's, Genki 1 and 2 on their textbook and workbook formats
3rd and last edition as of September 2024.

Genki 1 is a foundational level book that will help you get to a N5 level of japanese.

Genki 2 goes a bit deeper into the language, so you will expect to be a N4 after finishing both.

### Apps and other resources
<hr/>

You can start your journey with some famous apps like Duolingo, which I've been using for the last two months (July to Septebmer 2024).

There's also some apps that I discovered just recently: Renshuu and Kanji Study, which apparently helps you with hiragana, katakana, kanjis as well as some grammar, but haven't used them that much.

### Youtube
<hr/>

I'd definitively recommend Game Gengo ゲーム言語 youtube channel. He's a great guy and explains most of Japanese key points and even goes deeper in various important topics
